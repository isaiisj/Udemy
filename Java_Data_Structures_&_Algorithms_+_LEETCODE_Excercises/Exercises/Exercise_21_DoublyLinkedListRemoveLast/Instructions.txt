Implement the removeLast method that removes the last
node from the doubly linked list and returns it.

Return type: Node (the node that is being removed)



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. If the length of the doubly linked list is 0, return null.

    2. Create a temporary Node called temp and set it to the current 
       tail node.

    3. If the length of the doubly linked list is 1:

        - Set both the head and tail pointers of the list to null.

    4. If the length of the doubly linked list is greater than 1:

        - Set the tail pointer of the list to the previous node of
          the current tail node.

        - Set the next attribute of the new tail node to null.

        - Set the prev attribute of the temp node to null.

    5. Decrement the length attribute of the list by 1.

    6. Return the removed temp node.
