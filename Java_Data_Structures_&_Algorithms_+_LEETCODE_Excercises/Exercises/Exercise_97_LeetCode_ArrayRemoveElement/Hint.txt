Pseudo Code:

  1. Initialize an index i to 0. This will track the position in the array 
     where we can place an element that is not equal to val. This also represents 
     the new length of the array after all occurrences of val have been removed.

  2. Start a loop where j iterates from 0 to the length of the array:

      2.1. Check if the element at index j in the array is not equal to val.

      2.2. If true, assign the value at index j to the value at index i in the array, and then increment i by 1.

  3. Return the new length i after the loop ends. This represents the length of the array after all occurrences of val have been removed.
