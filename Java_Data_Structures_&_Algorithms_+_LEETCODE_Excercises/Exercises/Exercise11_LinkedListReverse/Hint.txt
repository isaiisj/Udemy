Here is a breakdown of what the code is doing:

    1. The first three lines of the method swap the head and tail pointers of the linked list,
       effectively reversing the order of the list.

    2. The next line initializes a variable called after to the next node of the original head node.

    3. The next line initializes a variable called before to null.

    4. The for loop then iterates through the linked list length number of times, where length 
       is the number of nodes in the linked list.

    5. In each iteration of the loop, the after variable is set to the next node of the current node,
       which will become the new temp node in the next iteration.

    6. The next pointer of the current node is then set to before, which effectively reverses the order
       of the nodes in the list.

    7. The before variable is set to the current node, which will become the new temp node in the next iteration.

    8. The temp variable is then set to after, which sets up the next iteration of the loop.
