Implement a pop method that removes and returns the
top node from the stack.

Return type: Node (the node that was popped from the stack)



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. If the height of the stack is 0, return null.

    2. Store the current top node in a temporary variable
       called temp.

    3. Update the top attribute to point to the next node
       in the stack.

    4. Set the next attribute of the temp node to null to 
       disconnect it from the stack.

    5. Decrement the height attribute of the stack by 1.

    6. Return the temp node.
