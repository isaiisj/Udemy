Implement the dequeue method for the Queue class, which
removes and returns the first node from the queue.

Return type: Node (the node that has been dequeued)



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. If the length of the queue is 0, return null.

    2. Create a temporary Node variable called temp and set it
       to the current first node.

    3. If the length of the queue is 1, set both the first and 
       last pointers of the queue to null.

    4. If the length of the queue is greater than 1, perform the
       following tasks:
        a. Update the first pointer of the queueto point to the next node. 
        b. Set the next attribute of the temp node to null.

    5. Decrement the length attribute of the queue by 1.

    6. Return the temp node.
