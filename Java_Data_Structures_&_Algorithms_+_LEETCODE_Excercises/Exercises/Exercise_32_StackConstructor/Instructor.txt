Implement a Stack class with a constructor that initializes
a new stack with a given value.



The class should have the following attributes and constructor:

    1. A Node class that represents the nodes of the stack:

        - An int attribute called value that stores the value of the node.

        - A Node attribute called next that points to the next node in the stack.

        - A constructor that accepts an integer value as an argument and
          initializes the value attribute with the given value.

    2. A private Node attribute called top that points to the top node of the stack.

    3. A private int attribute called height that keeps track of the number 
       of elements in the stack.

    4. A constructor for the Stack class that performs the following tasks:

        - Accepts an integer value as an argument, which will be the value 
          of the first node in the stack.

        - Creates a new Node object called newNode with the given value.

        - Initializes the top attribute with the newNode.

        - Sets the height attribute to 1.
