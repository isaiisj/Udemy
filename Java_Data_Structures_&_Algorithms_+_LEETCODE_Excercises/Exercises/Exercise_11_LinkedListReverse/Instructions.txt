Implement a method called reverse that reverses the order of
the nodes in the linked list.

When solving the reverse() method, students are not allowed 
to create a new list or use any additional data structures 
besides the linked list itself.

They must reverse the nodes in the existing linked list by
manipulating the pointers between them.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. The process of reversing the linked list should be done
       in one pass of the linked list.

    2. Create a temporary Node object called temp and set it to
       the head attribute of the list.

    3. Set the head attribute of the list to the current tail attribute.

    4. Set the tail attribute of the list to the temporary Node object.

    5. Create a Node object called after and set it to the next 
       attribute of the temporary Node object.

    6. Create a Node object called before and initialize it to null.

    7. Loop through the linked list using a for loop with a counter 
       variable i, starting from 0 and ending at the length attribute 
       of the list. 
            a. Set the after attribute to the next attribute of the 
               temporary Node object. 
            b. Set the next attribute of the temporary Node object
               to the before attribute. 
            c. Set the before attribute to the temporary Node object.
            d. Set the temporary Node object to the after attribute.

    8. The method has no return value.
