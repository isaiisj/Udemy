Create a simple binary search tree class called
BinarySearchTree with a Node inner class and a 
root attribute to hold the reference to the root
node of the tree.



The class should include the following:

    1. A Node inner class with the following properties:

        - An integer value.

        - A reference to the left child node.

        - A reference to the right child node.

        - A constructor that takes an integer value and
          initializes the node with it.

    2. A root attribute that will store a reference to the
       root node of the tree.
