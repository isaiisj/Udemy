2. Check if the linked list is empty. If it is, point both head and tail to newNode. 
   Don't forget to update the length.

3. Set the next pointer of the tail to point to the newNode, and then update the tail
   to point to the newNode. Again, don't forget to update the length.

4. Test your code with different input values to make sure it's working as expected.
