Draw out a small linked list on paper and walk through the steps of the method manually.

Start at the head of the linked list and iterate through each node until you reach the last node. 
Make sure you keep track of the previous node along the way.

Then, update the tail of the linked list to be the previous node, remove the reference to 
the original tail node, and decrement the length of the linked list. Finally, make sure to 
handle the case where the linked list is now empty.

Walking through the method manually on a small linked list can help to visualize the steps
and understand how they work together to remove the last node from the linked list.
