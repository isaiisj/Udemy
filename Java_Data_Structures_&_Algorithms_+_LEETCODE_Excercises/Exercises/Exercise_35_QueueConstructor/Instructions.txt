Create a Queue class that represents a queue data
structure using nodes.



Implement the constructor and instance variables as follows:

    1. Create a private instance variable first that will store
       a reference to the first node in the queue.

    2. Create a private instance variable last that will store a
       reference to the last node in the queue.

    3. Create a private instance variable length that will store
       the current length of the queue.

    4. Create a nested Node class with an integer value and a 
       reference to the next Node in the queue.

    5. Implement a constructor for the Queue class that takes an
       integer value as an argument, creates a new Node with the
       given value, and initializes the first, last, and length 
       instance variables.
