Implement the enqueue method for the Queue class, which 
adds a new node to the end of the queue.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. Accept an integer value as an argument, which will be 
       the value of the new node.

    2. Create a new Node object called newNode with the given value.

    3. If the length of the queue is 0, set both the first and last
       pointers of the queue to newNode.

    4. If the length of the queue is greater than 0, perform the 
       following tasks: 
        a. Set the next attribute of the current last node to newNode. 
        b. Update the last pointer of the queue to point to newNode.

    5. Increment the length attribute of the queue by 1.
