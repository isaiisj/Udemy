Implement a method called findKthFromEnd that returns the
k-th node from the end of the list.

If the list has fewer than k nodes, the method should 
return null.

Note: This implementation of the Linked List class does not
have the length attribute.

Method signature:

    public Node findKthFromEnd(int k)


Example:

    LinkedList myList = new LinkedList(1);
    myList.append(2);
    myList.append(3);
    myList.append(4);
    myList.append(5);
     
    Node result = myList.findKthFromEnd(2); // Output: Node with value 4
     
    result = myList.findKthFromEnd(5); // Output: Node with value 1
     
    result = myList.findKthFromEnd(6); // Output: null


Note:

In this problem, you should use the two-pointer technique to 
efficiently find the k-th node from the end of the linked list.
