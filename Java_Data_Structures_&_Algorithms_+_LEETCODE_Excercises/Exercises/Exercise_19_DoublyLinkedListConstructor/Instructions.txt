Design a class called DoublyLinkedList that represents a
doubly linked list.

The class should have the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:

    1. head: a Node object that represents the first node in
       the doubly linked list.

    2. tail: a Node object that represents the last node in 
       the doubly linked list.

    3. length: an integer representing the number of nodes in
       the doubly linked list.



Inner class Node:

    1. value: an integer representing the value of the node.

    2. next: a Node object representing the next node in the 
       doubly linked list.

    3. prev: a Node object representing the previous node in the
       doubly linked list.

    4. A constructor that accepts an integer value as an argument 
       and initializes the value attribute.



Methods:

    1. Constructor DoublyLinkedList: a constructor that accepts an
       integer value as an argument, initializes a new Node object 
       called newNode with the given value, sets both the head and 
       tail attributes of the list to the newNode, and initializes
       the length attribute to 1.
