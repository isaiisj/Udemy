Pseudo Code:

  1. printItems Method

      Purpose: This method is designed to print integer 
      values from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) on separate lines.

  2. printItems Method Signature

      It is a public method, so it can be accessed from any other class.

      It is a static method, meaning it belongs to the class it is defined 
      in rather than an instance of that class.

      The method has a void return type, indicating that it does not return any value.

      The method accepts a single parameter, n, of type int.

  3. Method Body

      The method uses a for loop to iterate through a series of numbers, 
      starting from 0 and ending at n - 1.

  4. Loop Structure

      Initialization: int i = 0 initializes the loop counter i to 0.

      Condition: i < n is the loop's termination condition. 
      The loop will continue iterating as long as i is less than n.

      Post Iteration Operation: i++ increments i by 1 after each loop iteration.

  5. Loop Body

      System.out.println(i) is executed for each iteration of the loop. 
      It prints the current value of i to the console followed by a new line.

In a nutshell, this method prints a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) to the console, each on a new line.
