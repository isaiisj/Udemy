/*

This method uses two pointers, slow and fast, and advances them 
at different speeds through the list. The slow pointer moves one
step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
By the time the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the 
slow pointer will be at the middle node.

Example Odd Number of Nodes:

Let's walk through the algorithm when the linked list has 5 elements. 
We'll denote these as:

Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node4 -> Node5.

Initially:

    slow = Node1

    fast = Node1



First Iteration:

    1. slow = slow.next → slow = Node2

    2. fast = fast.next.next → fast = Node3

Here, slow is at Node2 and fast is at Node3.



Second Iteration:

Now, let's check the while condition:

    1. fast is not null (it's Node3).

    2. fast.next is also not null (it's Node4).

We go into the loop again:

    1. slow = slow.next → slow = Node3

    2. fast = fast.next.next → fast = Node5

Here, slow is at Node3 and fast is at Node5.



Third Iteration:

Now, let's check the while condition again:

    fast is not null (it's Node5).

    fast.next is null (end of the list).



The while loop will stop because the condition 
fast != null && fast.next != null is not fully met.

The method then returns slow, which points to Node3, the middle
element in this 5-element linked list.



Example Even Number of Nodes:

Let's walk through what happens when the linked list has 4 elements. We'll denote these as:

Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node4

Initially: slow = Node1, fast = Node1


First Iteration:

slow = slow.next → slow = Node2

fast = fast.next.next → fast = Node3

Here, slow points to the second node, and fast points to the third node.


Second Iteration:

Now, let's check the while condition:

fast is not null (it's Node3).

fast.next is also not null (it's Node4).

So, we go into the loop again:

slow = slow.next → slow = Node3

fast = fast.next.next → fast = null


In the second iteration, slow moves to Node3 and fast tries to jump two steps 
ahead, but it ends up at null.

Now, the while loop will stop. fast is null, so the condition 
fast != null && fast.next != null will not be true.


The method returns slow, which is pointing to Node3, the third element in this
4-element linked list. In the case of an even-numbered linked list, the algorithm
returns the second middle element.
