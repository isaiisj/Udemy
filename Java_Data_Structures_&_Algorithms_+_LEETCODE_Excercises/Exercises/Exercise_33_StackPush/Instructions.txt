Implement a push method that adds a new node with a given
value to the top of the stack.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. Accept an integer value as an argument, which will
       be the value of the new node.

    2. Create a new Node object called newNode with the given
       value.

    3. If the height of the stack is 0, set the top attribute
       to the newNode.

    4. If the height of the stack is greater than 0, perform
       the following tasks:

        - Set the next attribute of the newNode to the current
          top node.

        - Update the top attribute to point to the newNode.

    5. Increment the height attribute of the stack by 1.
