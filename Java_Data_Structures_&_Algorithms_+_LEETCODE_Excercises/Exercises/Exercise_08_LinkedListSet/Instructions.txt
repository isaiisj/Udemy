Implement a method called set that updates the value of
a node in the linked list by its index.

Return type: boolean

Method signature: public boolean set(int index, int value)



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. Accept an integer index as an argument, representing
       the index of the node to be updated.

    2. Accept an integer value as an argument, representing 
       the new value to set for the node at the specified index.

    3. Call the get method with the provided index to obtain a
       pointer to the node at the specified index.

    4. If the node exists (i.e., the get method returns a non-null value),
       update the node's value with the provided value and return true.

    5. If the node does not exist (i.e., the get method returns null),
       return false.
