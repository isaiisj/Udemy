In the Stack: Intro video we discussed how stacks are
commonly implemented using an ArrayList instead of a 
Linked List.

Write the push method to add an item onto a stack that
is implemented with an ArrayList.

We will modify the Stack class to be able to store multiple
data types by using a generic parameter type <T>. This will
allow the class to hold Integers, Characters or any other 
data type.

Return type: void
