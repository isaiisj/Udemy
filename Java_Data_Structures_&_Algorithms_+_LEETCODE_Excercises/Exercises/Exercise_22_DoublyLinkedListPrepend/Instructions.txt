Implement the prepend method that adds a new node to the
beginning of the doubly linked list.

Return type: void



The method should perform the following tasks:

    1. Accept an integer value as an argument, which will be
       the value of the new node.

    2. Create a new Node object called newNode with the given
       value.

    3. If the length of the doubly linked list is 0:

        - Set both the head and tail pointers of the list to 
          the newNode.

    4. If the length of the doubly linked list is greater than 0:

        - Set the next attribute of the newNode to the current
          head node.

        - Set the prev attribute of the current head node to the
          newNode.

        - Update the head pointer of the list to point to the newNode.

    5. Increment the length attribute of the list by 1.
