  a. Start a for loop that will run n times

    i, During each iteration, i is the current loop count, starting from 0 and ending at n - 1

    ii. Inside the loop, print the current value of i

2. End the function definition

3. Call the function print_items with a specific number (e.g., print_items(10))
