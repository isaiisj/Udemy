'''
Flooring a Number
You can floor a number or remove all decimal places using the int() function which converts a 
floating point number (with decimal places) into an integer (whole number).

int(3.738492) # Becomes 3

Rounding a Number
However, if you want to round a decimal number to the nearest whole number using the traditional mathematical way, 
where anything over .5 rounds up and anything below rounds down. Then you can use the python round() function.

round(3.738492) # Becomes 4

round(3.14159) # Becomes 3

round(3.14159, 2) # Becomes 3.14

Assignment Operators
Assignment operators such as the addition assignment operator += will add the number on 
the right to the original value of the variable on the left and assign the new value to the variable.

bmi = 84 / 1.65 ** 2

# Original Float with decimal places
print(bmi)

# Flooring the number by converting it into int
print(int(bmi))

# Rounding the number into a whole number
print(round(bmi))

# Rounding only to 2 decimal places
print(round(bmi, 2))


## Accumulate

# User scores a point
