- Remember your answer should start from 1 and go up to and including 100.

- Each number/text should be printed on a separate line.

- Remember on Day 3, you learnt to use the modulo operator %  to check if a number is odd or even. 
  You will need to use the same concept to check if a number is divisible by 3 or by 5.



e.g.

number = 12
if number % 3 == 0:
    print("number is divisible by 3")
